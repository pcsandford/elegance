Introduction

A Touch of Elegance, a customizable interactive digital retail display for jewellery and similar items. You can add your own images to the display to achieve a powerful dynamic visual effect and interactive experience to showcase your latest products. Your customers will enjoy the classic movie theatre slideshow effect, and will also be able to move the slides manually via a simple swipe of the screen. You can view a working example here http://pcsandford.github.io
